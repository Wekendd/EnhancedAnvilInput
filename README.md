# EnhancedAnvilInput

Enhanced Anvil Input adds QOL improvements to the anvil GUI to make text input a smoother experience. Made specifically for Hypixel's anvil input system, but likely to work in other cases. See [here](https://youtu.be/PPH7YKCjM78) for a demo.

### Features

* **Text input always focused:** As soon as the anvil gui opens, the text input field will be focused, allowing you to type right away without clicking the field first.
* **Press Enter to finish text input:** The mod will click the output item for you when you press enter.

### Compatability
* Minecraft 1.8.9
* Forge
